# Recipe-Z

This project was created and worked on by Front-end developers Caleb/Brad and by Back-end developer Winter.

## Overview 

In this collaborative project, the three of us have worked both separately on files and together in a vscode liveshare to add our work.
Caleb and Brad have worked on the frontend together dividing tasks based on the day. For instance, some days Caleb would work more on building components while Brad styles them and vice versa.
We found that this strategy not only gives us experience on this style of project but also gives us experience working with someone else's code.
Winter on the other hand with the hardest job took on the responsibility of linking his backend project to the front since he worked with a new technology for this project. 
Our tasks were divided on Jira for a coordinated development.
This project is still in development with A LOT of work to due so bare with us as we are under construction!
